			Find the example Word Count code in	the	Hadoop release you downloaded.	Get it	to run in the IDE on

			and a path	to an output directory (that directory should not exist). Once the program runs	fine, look at it	
			closely and see what Map and Reduce are doing.	Use the	debugging perspective, set breakpoints in the	
			map and reduce functions, then	experiment by stepping through the code to see how it is	processing
